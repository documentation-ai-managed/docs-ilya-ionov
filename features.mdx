## Document Organization and Folders

You organize documents into hierarchical folders, mimicking your project's structure. Create root folders for guides, APIs, and changelogs, then nest subfolders for specifics.

  <Step title="Create Folder" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to the root directory. Click the `+ Folder` button and name it `api-reference`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Documents" icon="file-text">
    Drag MDX files into the folder or use the upload interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tag for Filtering" icon="tag">
    Assign tags like `internal` or `public` to each document.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

    message: "Update API endpoints",
    changes: ["docs/api.mdx"]
  });
  console.log(`Committed: ${commit.id}`);
  ````

  ````javascript
  // Revert to version
  const revert = await client.revert({
    docId: "api-reference",
    version: "v1.2.0"
  });
  console.log("Reverted successfully");
  ````
</CodeGroup>
